# Python-Palindrome
'''
Want to see if your string is a Palindrome (reads the same backwards as forwards)? You may never need this, but it sure is interesting!

message = #Enter a work to see if it is a pal indrome
inverse = message[::-1]
if message == inverse:
    print(message,'is a pal indrome')
else:
    print(message,'is not a pal indrome')
